# GhostGambit
A roleplaying toolbox for experienced, and cadaverous roleplayers.

Currently slated to *only* support TotalRP3, but I'll be looking into adding support for other addons in the future.

## Character Sheets
Character sheets can be created and swapped out at will, as well as shared with other players, similar to regular RP profiles.

A character sheet holds all of the information about your character. Traits, attributes, name, history, etc.

Currently, the following attributes are supported:
* Strength
* Dexterity
* Constitution
* Intelligence
* Wisdom
* Charisma

Additionally, these attributes will be accompanied by modifiers. Players will inherit base modifiers from their attributes, and these will be able to be further increased, or reduced, by the Dungeon Master (per-session, not persistent), items, or by the player's selected traits.

Players will also be able to choose skills that will be affected both positively, and negatively, by their attributes. i.e. lockpicking, persuasion, investigation, perception, etc.

## Dungeon Flow
Dungeon Masters will be able to request skill check rolls from players in their group. Players will then roll with their modifiers and return the value to the Dungeon Master. Pure attribute rolls will also be supported.

Dungeon Masters will also be able to apply temporary buffs and debuffs to the players in the group, which can affect their roll modifiers.

Players will have a health attribute that can be set alongside the rest of the attributes. Player's health will be controlled solely by the player, but will be visible to all players in the group.

## TotalRP3: Extended Support
This is a big gamble, and I haven't even looked into it at all yet, but it *would* be very nice to have items that could affect player's modifiers and skills. This will likely require a blood sacrifice or a generous donation of gil to Solanya.
